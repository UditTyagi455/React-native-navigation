    title: "Loktak Lake,Manipur",
    description:
      "Loktak Lake is a freshwater lake in Northeast India. It is the largest freshwater lake in South Asia along with Manchar Lake in Pakistan. It is a pulsating la, with surface area varying from 250 sq km to 500 sq km during rainy season with a typical area of 287 sq km. This ancient lake plays an important role in the economy of Manipur. It serves as a source of water for hydropower generation, irrigation and drinking water supply. The lake is also a source of livelihood for the rural fishermen who live in the surrounding areas and on phumdis, also known as phumshangs. Human activity has led to severe pressure on the lake ecosystem. 55 rural and urban hamlets around the lake have a population of about 100,000 people. Considering the ecological status and its biodiversity values, the lake was initially designated as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention on 23 March 1990. It was also listed under the Montreux Record on 16 June 1993, a record of Ramsar sites where changes in ecological character have occurred, are occurring or are likely to occur",
